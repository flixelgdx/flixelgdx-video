/**
 * Minimal libvlc 3.x binding used by the desktop video backend.
 *
 * <p>The methods are registered against the discovered libvlc shared library through
 * JNA's direct mapping, which binds each declaration below to the exported C symbol of
 * the same name via JNI. Only the functions the video pipeline needs are mapped; this
 * is intentionally not a general-purpose libvlc wrapper.
 *
 * <p>All callback interfaces are invoked from libvlc's own decoder threads, never from
 * the render thread. Implementations must therefore stay allocation-free and hand data
 * over through fields that the render thread polls (see {@code FlixelVlcVideo}).
